       Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and <br/>
       everything in it's orbit. I recently began to be <br/>
       fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing <br/>
       apps and building websites. I am keen to <br/>
       gain more knowledge in the field. For this reason, I <br/>
       am pursuing my dreams with the EPAM company which I <br/>
       is willing in the near future to work with this great team. <br/>
       In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant <br/>
       and friendly addition to your team.
